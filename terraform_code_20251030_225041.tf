In the refined Terraform code, we've added the server-side encryption configuration to the bucket using AWS KMS key. We've also configured lifecycle policies for cost optimization, which includes expiring old versions of objects, transitioning infrequent access data to a lower storage class, moving to cold storage, and deleting old versions after 7 days.
We've also configured access permissions for the bucket so that it can only be accessed by authorized users.
Finally, we've added outputs for the S3 bucket name and the lifecycle policies.
