      "review": "This Terraform module demonstrates an exceptionally strong and secure S3 bucket configuration. It meticulously implements AWS and security best practices, including dedicated KMS encryption with robust key policies (featuring rotation and conditional access for S3 service and application roles), comprehensive public access blocking, versioning, and object ownership enforcement. The lifecycle configurations are well-designed for cost optimization and data retention. A dedicated logging bucket is configured with highly restrictive access policies, ensuring secure and auditable log delivery. The use of random suffixes, conditional logic for IAM roles, and clear commenting further enhances the quality and maintainability of the code. No critical security vulnerabilities or architectural flaws were identified; the few suggestions are minor refinements for even higher maturity and compliance levels.",
      "suggestions": [
        "For the KMS key policy, consider establishing dedicated administrative IAM roles or groups (e.g., 'KMSAdmins') with specific permissions, rather than explicitly granting `kms:*` to the AWS account root user. This aligns with the principle of least privilege and improves auditability, although the current configuration is functional.",
        "While SSE-S3 (AES256) is generally acceptable for logging buckets, for environments with extremely stringent compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA, FedRAMP), consider using KMS encryption for the logging bucket as well. This might involve creating a separate KMS key for logs to maintain separation of concerns.",
        "Add an output for the ARN of the logging bucket (`s3_logging_bucket_arn`) for consistency and easy programmatic referencing, similar to how the main bucket's ARN is provided.",
        "Consider adding a `bucket_prefix` or `tags` validation to the input variables to enforce naming conventions or required tags for better governance, especially in larger organizations."
