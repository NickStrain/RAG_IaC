      "review": "This Terraform code provides a very robust and secure configuration for AWS S3 buckets, complete with dedicated logging, encryption (SSE-KMS for main data, SSE-S3 for logs), versioning, and comprehensive public access blocking. The use of `BucketOwnerEnforced` object ownership is a modern best practice that significantly simplifies access control by eliminating ACLs. Lifecycle policies are well-defined for cost optimization and data retention. The KMS key setup is also strong, including rotation and a deletion window. The variable and output structure is clear and effective. Overall, this is an excellent foundation for secure and compliant S3 storage.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Consider adding a `condition` to the S3 service principal in the KMS key policy to restrict its use to specific S3 buckets or ARN patterns. For example, `\"kms:ViaService\": \"s3.region.amazonaws.com\"` and `\"kms:CallerAccount\": \"${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}\"`. This adds an extra layer of defense in depth.",
        "For the main bucket, if there will be specific access patterns (e.g., cross-account access for another service, or granting read-only access to a specific service principal), a dedicated `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource would be necessary. Currently, access is entirely reliant on IAM policies attached to users/roles in the same account.",
        "While `prevent_destroy = true` is excellent for critical buckets, ensure that the process for intentional deletion (e.g., during decommissioning) is well-documented or managed. This typically involves manually removing the lifecycle block or `terraform state rm`.",
        "The `log_bucket_policy` allows `s3:PutObject` for `logging.s3.amazonaws.com`. This is correct for S3 access logs. If other types of logs (e.g., CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs) were to be sent to this bucket, their respective service principals and `Action` (e.g., `s3:GetBucketAcl`, `s3:PutObjectAcl`) would need to be added to the policy.",
        "For lifecycle rules involving Glacier, consider if `Deep Archive` is a more cost-effective option for extremely long-term storage, depending on recovery time objectives. This would require an additional lifecycle transition rule."
      ],
      "issues": [
        "The KMS key policy grants `kms:*` action to the AWS account (Principal = { AWS = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id }). While this is a common practice to allow IAM to delegate permissions, it's a broad permission. It relies heavily on properly configured IAM policies for actual users/roles to restrict their KMS access. For specific use cases, more granular control might be considered within the key policy itself, though this often complicates delegation."
