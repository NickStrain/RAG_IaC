    "review": "This Terraform code provides an excellent foundation for deploying a highly secure and durable AWS S3 bucket. It adheres to many AWS and Terraform best practices, including robust security configurations (encryption, public access block, versioning), clear variable definitions, and proper use of outputs. The primary area for improvement is enhancing lifecycle management and access logging, along with refining the `force_destroy` commentary to reinforce its inherent dangers. Overall, it's a very well-structured and secure module for an S3 bucket.",
    "suggestions": [
      "**Enhance `force_destroy` comment**: Remove the suggestion to enable `force_destroy` for testing. Instead, reinforce that `false` is the critical production default and emphasize the significant data loss risk if set to `true`.",
      "**Introduce Lifecycle Rules**: Add an `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` resource to define rules for managing object lifecycles, such as automatically moving old versions to lower-cost storage classes (e.g., Glacier) or deleting them after a certain period. This helps manage storage costs.",
      "**Implement Access Logging**: Consider adding an `aws_s3_bucket_logging_v2` resource to enable access logging for the S3 bucket. This requires another S3 bucket to store the logs, providing valuable audit trails for who accessed what and when.",
      "**KMS Encryption Option**: Introduce a variable (e.g., `s3_encryption_type`) to allow users to choose between `AES256` (SSE-S3) or `aws:kms` (SSE-KMS), and optionally provide a variable for the KMS key ID if `aws:kms` is selected. This offers greater flexibility and compliance options.",
      "**Bucket Policy for Granular Access**: Depending on the use case, a dedicated `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource could be added to define more granular access permissions for specific IAM roles/users or cross-account access, if needed, though this would depend on the bucket's intended purpose.",
      "**Centralized Tag Management**: While tags are present, for larger environments, consider a `locals` block to define common tag sets that can be merged with resource-specific tags, ensuring consistency across more resources."

      "Explicit AWS and random provider versions are defined, ensuring predictable deployments.",
      "Clear and descriptive variables with appropriate types and sensible default values, promoting reusability and clarity.",

      "- Versioning is explicitly enabled, protecting against accidental deletions and enabling recovery.",
      "- Server-side encryption (SSE-S3/AES256) is enabled by default for all objects, ensuring data at rest is encrypted.",
      "- Comprehensive Public Access Block is enabled, effectively preventing all forms of public access to the bucket.",
      "- Ownership Controls are set to `BucketOwnerPreferred`, aligning with current AWS best practices for object ownership.",
      "Appropriate tags are applied to the S3 bucket, aiding in resource organization, cost allocation, and policy enforcement.",
      "Useful output variables (bucket name, ARN, ID) are provided, making it easy to reference the created resource in other configurations or for external tools.",
      "Good inline comments explain the purpose and importance of various configurations."
    ],
    "issues": [
      "The comment for `force_destroy` suggesting its use for 'testing or specific scenarios' while keeping it `false` by default is contradictory and potentially misleading. Enabling `force_destroy` is a very dangerous operation in production environments and should generally be avoided, even for testing, unless absolutely necessary with extreme caution.",
      "While `AES256` is a good default for server-side encryption, there's no option to easily switch to KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) which might be preferred for some compliance requirements or when integrating with specific key management strategies."
    ],
    "security_concerns": [
      "The current code implements robust security configurations for the S3 bucket, including versioning, server-side encryption, and a full public access block. No immediate critical security concerns are identified in the implemented configuration.",
      "The only minor security *misguidance* comes from the `force_destroy` comment which, if followed by an inexperienced user, could lead to accidental data loss in a production environment."
